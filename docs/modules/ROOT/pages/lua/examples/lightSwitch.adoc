= Light Switch Example

This small program uses a panel, a switch on the panel, which will control a light that is connected on the network.

More info on the Modular Panel and Events that this example uses xref:lua/guide/ModularPanelAndEvents.adoc[can be found here].

== Setup

You will need: +

1. A computer with a Lua CPU, a little bit of RAM, and an EEPROM
2. A modular panel with a 2 position switch in the middle of the panel
3. One of the lights available in the base game

Connect the computer to a network pole. Connect the light and the control panel to the network pole using network cables.
Plug in the Text EEPROM and paste the code below in the code editor.
Run the computer and switch the button on the control panel on/off.

== Code

[source,Lua]
----
local panels = component.proxy(component.findComponent(classes.LargeControlPanel))
local lights = component.proxy(component.findComponent(classes.LightSource))

local panel = panels[1]
local light = lights[1]

-- The switch is expected to be in the middle of the panel
local switch = panel:getModule(5, 5, 0)

event.ignoreAll()
event.clear()

event.listen(switch)

while true do
    local e, s = event.pull()
    if s == switch and e == "ChangeState" then
        light.isLightEnabled = s.state
    end
end
