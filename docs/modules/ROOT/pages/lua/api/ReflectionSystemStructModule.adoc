=== **structs** : xref:/lua/api/ReflectionSystemStructModule.adoc#_structlib[StructLib]
A peseudo table that can be used to look up struct types (which can then be used to easily construct a struct of that type).
Ideal usage of it is `structs.MyStruct` (with a Constructor `structs.Vector(x,y,z)`).
Since the type lookup occurs in the metatable-function, you can still use the []-Operator in the case
you want to look up something based on a dynamic string e.g. `structs[myStringVar]` works just fine.
