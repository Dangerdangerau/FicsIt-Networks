== Types

=== **ReflectionFunction**
Functions of the reflection system are not directly Lua Functions, instead they are this type.
This has various reason, but one neat thing it allows us to do, is to provide documentation capabilities.
Instead of just calling it, you can also ask for information about the function it self.
And it makes debugging a bit easier.
